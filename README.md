**Due to the current way the game loads assets for the game you'll have to modify one of the vanilla files in order to make this mod run :**

>Navigate to the Steam directory Endless Space 2 is installed in
>Go to steamapps/common/EndlessSpace2/Public/Gui
>Download the file GuiElements[Affinities].xml at the root of this repo and paste it on top of the one in the game's directory

Devs have been notified and a fix is coming, in the meantime you'll have to do this manipulation once before launching the game. If you download the game again or revalidate your files you'll have to do it again.
